  <h1>Rules of the Betting system</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Betting fee is 10 Euros for the whole championship</li>
    <li>Prices are: winner: 50%, 2nd: 30% and 3rd: 20% ranked by
    points. The price will be split equally between players with
    same points.</li>
    <li>Placement of game bets is possible until 60 min before each
    individual game starts. The time left until the bet closes is
    indicated on the page (but don't wait till the last minute!).
    We count as the result the goals after regular 90 min
    (including stoppage time). Goals in over-time or penalty
    shoot-out are not considered.</li>
    <li>Placement of special bets (team: Champion, 4 Semi
    Finalists; players: Most Valuable Player, TopScorer) is
    possible until 14. June 2018, 16:00 (CET). If there is no clear
    annoucement of MVP, the bet will not count.</li>

        Point system: For the games you can try to predict the
        final result and you may get points for the correct
        tendency (win, loose, draw) or even for the correct result.
        Awarded points for each game are:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>phase</th>
            <th>tendency</th>
            <th>correct</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>group</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>3</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>last 16 and quarter finals</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>4</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>semi final</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>9</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>3rd place game</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>3</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>final</td>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>12</td>
          </tr>
        </table>Points for the special bets are:
        <ul>
          <li>World Champion 10 points</li>
          <li>MVP 8 points</li>
          <li>Top Scorer 8 points</li>
          <li>Semi Finalists 5 for each correct guess</li>
        </ul>

         General notes:
         While we try to be professional, and money is involved, glitches can happen.
         If you want to check for fraud, you can always save the EXCEL file of all the bets in the hour before the game starts and noone can change
         their bet anymore. Do not change anything in this EXCEL file, because this will invalidate the cryprographic signature.
