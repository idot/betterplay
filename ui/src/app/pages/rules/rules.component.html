         General notes:
         While we try to be professional and money is involved, glitches can happen. If you find something strange (e.g. a game that takes place and is therefore not locked for bets, please tell us)
         All database transactions are looged and fraud leads to annulment of your result.
         If you want to check for fraud, you can always save the EXCEL file of all the bets in the hour before the game starts and noone can change
         their bet anymore.
         Do not change anything in this EXCEL file, and don't change the name, because this will invalidate the cryptographic signature.
         </p>
         <p>
           Do not send any of the administrators an e-mail with bets. We will not enter the bets manually. Ensure that you have the technical ability to bet. Don't wait until the last minute.
           You can apply for a refund until 1 hour after the 1. game started by e-mail, afterwards your money is in the pot - even if you are stranded on an island without internet connection.
